			Glamor setup

1. Prerequirement.
Please install makedepend and libudev-devel firstly. 

2. Build xserver-glamor.

Then do the following steps one by one.
2.1. get latest glamor at github.

2.2 Setup xorg development environment, use xserver-glamor to 
    replace the official xserver. 
 Here is the link of how to setup xorg development environment: 
 http://www.x.org/wiki/ModularDevelopersGuide
 
 For most of the packages, we prefer latest git version. Especially
 for the mesa package.

 When build mesa, use the following parameters: (assume you want to 
 install the experimental xorg to /opt/gfx-test) 
#mesa/./autogen.sh --prefix=/opt/gfx-test --with-egl-platforms=drm --disable-gallium  --disable-gallium-egl

 build xserver-glamor as below:
#xserver-glamor/./autogen.sh --disable-glx --enable-kdrive --enable-xephyr

 Once you finish all the building process, you can have a try as below:
xserver-glamor#startx -- `pwd`/hw/xfree86/Xorg If you can find the 
 following messages on the console, then everything should work correctly.
Mesa: Initializing x86-64 optimizations


3. Restrictions:

Currently, glamor doesn't support glx extension, will be fixed in the future.

Glamor setup done.

				X Server

The X server accepts requests from client applications to create windows,
which are (normally rectangular) "virtual screens" that the client program
can draw into.

Windows are then composed on the actual screen by the X server
(or by a separate composite manager) as directed by the window manager,
which usually communicates with the user via graphical controls such as buttons
and draggable titlebars and borders.

For a comprehensive overview of X Server and X Window System, consult the
following article:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_server

All questions regarding this software should be directed at the
Xorg mailing list:

        http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/xorg

Please submit bug reports to the Xorg bugzilla:
